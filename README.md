# AML-Transaction-Monitoring-using-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates how to detect potential money laundering activities in financial transactions using Python and machine learning techniques. It combines supervised classification (with labeled data) and unsupervised anomaly detection (for unlabeled data) to build a practical anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring framework.
